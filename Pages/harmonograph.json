Essentially, they're made up of a number of pendulums (2 or 3) that move independently in different axes, and their position is then added up to produce a path. The images that form from simply adding harmonic motion together can be quite stunning, so naturally I wanted to build one. Unfortunately, I was never able to make  a physical harmonograph, so I eventually decided to make a harmono-graph in Desmos.\n\nThis is one of my most annotated and explained graphs, at least in terms of the input.\n\nLink: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/875211cd3d](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/875211cd3d)\n\nAnd here are some images:"
